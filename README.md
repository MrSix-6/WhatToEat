# WhatToEat
AI Agent for what to eat

# How it works

1. Users will start the process and prompt that they are hungry but do not know what to eat
2. Depending on what the user is feeling like, agent will suggest what to eat, taking into account weather, time and festivals.
3. Agent will then suggest where are the closest locations to get the food or how to potentially cook the food.
